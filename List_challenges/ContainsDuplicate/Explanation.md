The provided code defines a Python class `solution` that contains three different methods for detecting whether a list of integers (`nums`) contains duplicate elements. Here's a breakdown of each method and the logic behind how it works:

---

### **1. `bruteForceSoln` Method**

**Idea:**
This is the most basic and straightforward approach, often referred to as a brute-force solution. It compares every pair of elements in the list to check if any two elements are equal.

**How It Works:**
1. The outer `for` loop iterates over each element in the list (`element`).
2. The inner `for` loop iterates over the elements that come after the current element (`nums[i:]`).
3. It checks if the current `element` is equal to `element_i` from the inner loop.
4. If a match is found, the function returns `True` (indicating duplicates).
5. If no match is found after all comparisons, it returns `False`.

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\), since it compares every element with every other element.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as no extra space is used.

---

### **2. `sort_soln` Method**

**Idea:**
This solution takes advantage of the fact that duplicate elements will be adjacent to each other in a sorted list. By sorting the array and comparing adjacent elements, it simplifies the search for duplicates.

**How It Works:**
1. The `nums` list is sorted using `sorted(nums)`, which returns a new sorted version of the list.
2. A `for` loop iterates through the sorted list, checking each element against its immediate neighbor (`modifed_nums[i] == modifed_nums[i+1]`).
3. If two adjacent elements are equal, the function returns `True`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\), due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), since a new sorted list is created.

### **3. `hashSet_soln` Method**

**Idea:**
This approach uses a hash set to keep track of elements already seen. A set is an efficient data structure for membership testing.

**How It Works:**
1. A new empty set, `hashset`, is created.
2. The method iterates through the list `nums`.
3. For each element, it checks if the element is already in the set:
   - If yes, it means a duplicate exists, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, the element is added to the set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), since each membership test and insertion operation in a set is \(O(1)\) on average.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), since the set can grow up to the size of the list.

### **User Interaction**
At the end, the script allows the user to select one of these methods by inputting:
- `1` for `bruteForceSoln`
- `2` for `sort_soln`
- `3` for `hashSet_soln`

The selected method is applied to the test array `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. Depending on the method and whether duplicates are detected, the program prints either:
- `"the array has duplicated values"`, or
- `"the array has unique values"`.

---

### **Comparison of Methods**
1. **Efficiency:**
   - The `hashSet_soln` is the most efficient for large inputs because of its \(O(n)\) time complexity.
   - The `sort_soln` is less efficient due to the sorting step (\(O(n \log n)\)).
   - The `bruteForceSoln` is the least efficient due to its \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.

2. **Simplicity:**
   - `bruteForceSoln` is conceptually simple but inefficient.
   - `hashSet_soln` is both simple and efficient.
   - `sort_soln` is straightforward but involves extra overhead for sorting.

### **Output Example**
If the user selects `3` (hash set solution) and the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- The function will return `False` since there are no duplicates.
- The program will print: `"the array has unique values"`.
